Get Docker Engine - Community for CentOS

Uninstall old versions

Older versions of Docker were called docker or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them, along with associated dependencies.

#yum remove docker docker-client docker-client-latest docker-common docker-latest docker-latest-logrotate docker-logrotate  docker-engine

Install Docker Engine - Community
Install using the repository


Install required packages. yum-utils provides the yum-config-manager utility, and device-mapper-persistent-data and lvm2 are required by the devicemapper storage driver.

#yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2


Use the following command to set up the stable repository.

#yum-config-manager     --add-repo    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

#yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io  --skip-broken --nobest

#systemctl enable docker
#systemctl start docker
#systemctl status docker
